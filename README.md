✈ Transforming Travel Feedback into Data-Driven Insights 🗺️
I’m thrilled to share my latest Tableau project: an interactive British Airways Reviews dashboard, inspired by the excellent tutorial by Mo Chen. This project offers a vivid and dynamic exploration of passenger experiences across multiple dimensions.
Highlights include:
Average overall ratings broken down by month, by country, and by aircraft—perfect for spotting trends or identifying areas for improvement public.tableau.com+1

Insightful filters that allow users to dynamically explore metrics by traveler type, seat type, continent, and more—powerful tools for deep-diving into customer segments GitHub

A clean, polished tutorial format that made following along intuitive and effective; Mo Chen’s guidance made the step-by-step visualization build accessible even for intermediate Tableau users GitHub

Why it matters:
 Travel brands thrive when they deeply understand their customers. By leveraging dashboards like this, airlines can translate raw reviews into actionable strategies—whether improving service, enhancing routes, or elevating overall satisfaction.
A big shout-out to Mo Chen for creating such a clear and impactful tutorial—this has been a great learning experience!
Let me know if you’d like to see a live demo or discuss how this approach can be adapted for other industries.
